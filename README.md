The Objective of this project to design a simulation of self–driving cab.
The major goal is to demonstrate, in a simplified environment through which I can use RL techniques to develop an efficient and safe approach for tackling this problem.
The packages which i have used in this project are Open AI Gym ,Python ,Numpy ,Matplotlib.
While designing the simulation of self –driving car ,I have taken care of few things which are:-
 - Drop off the passenger to right location.
 - Save passenger’s time by taking minimum time possible to drop off.
 -Take care of passenger’s safety and traffic rules.
